Test 390.  This was a near-miss: I didn&#39;t break any sanitizer,
but it was a close call.  It exploits difference between SGML
parsing of comments and what you might expect.  It almost breaks
BeautifulSoup-based sanitizers, but not quite.  The string
below is parsed differently by BeautifulSoup and Firefox:
BeautifulSoup thinks the comment ends just before c,
but Firefox thinks it doesn&#39;t end until e.  It fails to break
BeautifulSoup-based parsers, because when BeautifulSoup pretty-prints
the output, it html-escapes the contents of the name attribute.
Unfortunately, the DOCTYPE declaration is essential.
