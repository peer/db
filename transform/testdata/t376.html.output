Test 376.  Test for a specific bug: the sanitizer has code like
<pre>
  for name, value in tag.attrs:
    if name not in attr_whitelist:
      del tag[name]
</pre>
This is buggy, because it mutates a list while iterating over it.
As a result, this buggy code might delete only every other attribute
instead of every attribute.  It can be exploited by introducing
useless attributes.
