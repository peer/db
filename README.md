PeerDB Search is an opinionated but flexible open source search system incorporating best practices in search and user
interfaces/experience to provide intuitive, fast, and easy to use search over both full-text data and semantic data
exposed as facets. The goal of the user interface is to allow users without technical knowledge to
easily find results they want, without having to write queries. The system also allows multiple data sources
to be used and merged together.

As a demonstration we provide a search service for Wikipedia articles and Wikidata data.

## GitHub mirror

There is also a [read-only GitHub mirror available](https://github.com/peer/db-search),
if you need to fork the project there.
